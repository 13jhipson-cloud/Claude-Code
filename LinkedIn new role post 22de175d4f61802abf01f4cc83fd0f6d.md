# LinkedIn new role post

I'm excited to announce that I have completed the graduate programme at Blenheim Chalcot and am now starting a new position as Finance Associate at Oakbrook.
Having spent the last few months focusing on finance transformation and automation, I look forward to continuing this work alongside an increased focus on Financial Planning & Analysis at one of the UK's leading consumer-lending FinTechs.
