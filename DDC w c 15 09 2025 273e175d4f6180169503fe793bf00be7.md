Done & Doing (in order of priority)

- **FB-BB Model:**
    - Updated model saved here: [FB BB Forecast 10 Dim Date.xlsx](https://oakbrookfinance365.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/financeteam/EYOqz9Rgi3pBnj0P-J2KwNsBPYFnUuRbxkgui6Lrn23sTQ?e=pIKwXn)
        
        ![](https://res-1.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/xlsx_16x16.png)
        
    - Model now shows the full cohort experience (triangles, curves, rates) for Emily's actuals, with pivots and slicers by all splits (see BB Outputs tabs).
    - The data only has 2 calendar months limiting the ability to show cohort triangles and curves
    - Still bumping into issues with cohort-specific views and computing the forecast due to the size of the dataset.
    - Model walkthrough/demo deck runs through the structure and logic of the model. Please let me know if I should make it more/less detailed: [FB BB Model Walkthrough.pptx](https://oakbrookfinance365.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/financeteam/Shared%20Documents/Forecasting/2025/FB%20BB%20Forecast/FB%20BB%20Model%20Walkthrough.pptx?d=w0a6e03eeba73466f9d7f8452403ff289&csf=1&web=1&e=ARYvro).

Considering

- **IAS39 FP&A improvements:** Scoped; pending updated IAS39 codes from Uzma.
- **FinOps Icenet Processes:**
    - Defining best approach to rework the approach to how we source and process the data (pending discussions with Dee & Will)
