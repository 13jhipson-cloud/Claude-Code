Budget model learnings:

- Start with the best minimum deliverable, target this then move onto building up from there as opposed to going for the gold standard then panicking to deliver the bear minimum if it doesn’t work out (spend a lot of time working with all the huge splits and a super elaborate model, only for it to be stripped back to the basics …),
- The difficulty and amount of work was simply too much for me to deal with - it’s beyond my level. Hate the feeling of spinning my wheels and not understanding so I want clearer guidance on exactly the tasks to do, what they involve, and how to do them so that I don’t get lost in the details .
