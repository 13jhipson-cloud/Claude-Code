| Sven Huckstadt (Finance Director) | Learnt Koodoo's revenue inside out, built good relationships with commercial team, and in a place where the invoice schedule is comfortable and efficient - overall great outcome | Lender report automation piece was a bit inefficient (more because it was kicked off before our involvement) | Try to simply things: focus on simplifying things (in the way I talk, approach, and do things) - translating complicated issues into simple terms is a real skill. Always think from their perspective and explaining it to a toddler, etc

Identify & Communicate roadblocks early: flag things early, don’t just put my head down and battle through things, be clear about what is and isn't possible, and if somethings taking longer than expected |
| Jess Bateson (Commercial and Operations Director) | The process is clearly improved now on the finance side and this was a relatively complex commercial structure to try and simplify and automate. You've done well in understanding how our revenue shares work in a relatively quick period of time and now probably know them better than me! This definitely required a lot of time and patience so well done. | Whilst the finance process is now quicker and more robust, more care should have been taken to ensure that Koodoo's Data and Commercial reporting processes that require Finance inputs were compatible with the changes, before they were released. This could have been done by properly scoping out work with Koodoo's data team and testing the full end to end data pipeline before retiring V1 of the invoicing schedule. This would have avoided a lot of wasted time (by Jack) in having to parallel process both V1 and V2 of the schedules for several months. |  |
| Avila Perreria (Finance Manager) | delivered exceptional results by leading the end-to-end restructuring and automation of critical finance processes. His ability to identify inefficiencies and rebuild workflows from the ground up was instrumental in driving both accuracy and scalability. The quality of execution was consistently high, and the solutions implemented have had a lasting impact on our operational effectiveness.  | While the technical and process outcomes were excellent, there is an opportunity to improve communication and alignment with the wider team and stakeholders. More frequent updates and context-sharing would help keep all parties better informed and aligned throughout process changes.  | Continue to drive high-impact automation and process redesign. Proactively share updates and progress with relevant stakeholders to foster transparency and stronger collaboration. Consider setting up regular check-ins or process update summaries to enhance visibility of ongoing improvements. |
| Shirley Voong (Finance Manager) | Jack did a great job leading this project, keeping things moving at a solid pace thanks to clear and consistent communication. He tackled inefficiencies head-on and drove real improvements, resulting in a more accurate and efficient process. |  One thing to work on would be knowing when to zoom out a bit instead of getting too caught up in the finer details. His thoroughness was definitely a strength, but sometimes a more high-level approach could have kept things even more efficient. | Whilst the automation project was successful at an appropriate time frame, an future improvement would be to consider what level of detail to work to whilst also weighing up time and effort, and impact on results. |

| Jess Bateson (Commercial and Operations Director) | We seem to have much fewer issues with reporting and payments since the transition so this seems like it has been fairly successful to me. You've added good structure to our filing process and I suspect this is now in a much cleaner state to hand over than it would have been 6 months ago.You're very quick to ask clarifying questions about our revenue structures and through doing this identified a few areas of revenue that aren't properly being reported for. | There were a few areas of revenue missed off the invoicing schedule (e.g. Santander/Clearscore's true up) - but difficult to know if this is something you could have controlled directly as the process is split across a few of you. |  |
| Avila Perreria (Finance Manager) | took full ownership of revenue-related finance and accounting processes during a critical transition phase, demonstrating diligence and a strong eye for detail. He successfully corrected inherited errors and implemented automation to resolve inefficiencies, showcasing both accountability and initiative.  | To complement the impressive technical contributions, there’s room to strengthen cross-functional communication—particularly during transitional or high-change periods—ensuring the broader team is aware of adjustments and their impact. | Maintain the high standard of ownership and problem-solving in complex finance domains. Increase communication touchpoints during process overhauls. Engage earlier with key stakeholders when process changes are underway to anticipate questions and secure alignment. |
| Shirley Voong (Finance Manager) |  Jack put a lot of time and effort into the automation project and improving the invoicing schedule revenue accounting, which really paid off. His focus in these areas made a big difference and helped streamline the process with less errors. |  Although the invoicing schedule revenue work did take up a lot of time, an area of improvement would have been to seek ownership of even the smaller (but equally important) revenue tasks.

The only downside was that, because  he was so focused on these parts, other areas of revenue didn’t really end up being passed to him. |  The inheritance of the main bulk of revenue related finance was successful but the less time-heavy revenue related finance was not passed on (e.g. KMC revenue). An area of improvement would be to not forget about the smaller tasks when working on something bigger. |

| Jess Bateson (Commercial and Operations Director) | You're
  naturally curious and this will be ridiculously helpful in a finance /
  commercial role - you like to understand the nuts and bolts of product
  configurations & you ask questions until you're sure of the answer
    
    You are a great addition to team Koodoo and we'll be very sad to lose you
  to another BC company, you have been great Jack! | Attention to detail and customer-focused mindset - you can't send reporting with another aggregators name on it, even if there is no data and it is just in column headers, this is not good practice so watch out for this |  |
