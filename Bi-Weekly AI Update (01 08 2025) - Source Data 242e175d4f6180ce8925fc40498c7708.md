# Bi-Weekly AI Update (01/08/2025) - Source Data

## Executive summary

- **GPT‑5 and open‑weight models on the horizon.** OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman confirmed that the next flagship model, **GPT‑5**, is expected to launch in early **August 2025**, combining the reasoning capabilities of the “o‑series” models into a single system and accompanied by mini and nano versions for different use cases[[1]](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%2C%20I%20heard,as%20early%20as%20next%20month). An open‑weight model similar to the O3 mini is also planned, marking the first time OpenAI has released an open‑weight model since 2019[[2]](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad#:~:text=While%20GPT,risk%20areas.%E2%80%9D). This signals a major upgrade in general‑purpose reasoning available via ChatGPT and API and offers potential for internal use on private data.
- **FP&A automation tools mature.** AI‑native platforms built specifically for FP&A workflows are now delivering fully automated forecasts, real‑time variance analysis and board‑ready reporting – capabilities that were “out of reach” only a few years ago[[3]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Finance%20teams%20are%20under%20growing,It%E2%80%99s%20becoming%20the%20foundation). Platforms such as **Concourse** embed AI agents directly into workflows, automate reporting, accelerate forecasting and allow users to query live data sources via natural language[[4]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Finance%20teams%20today%20are%20expected,and%20surface%20insights%20on%20demand). Finance teams are beginning to leverage generic LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) as assistants for writing policies, summarising documents and market research[[5]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=How%20Finance%20Teams%20Use%20ChatGPT%2C,Claude%2C%20and%20Perplexity).
- **Regulation and governance catch up.** The **FCA’s Supercharged Sandbox**, launched in June, invites financial‑services firms to test AI prototypes with enhanced computing and data resources; applications close on **11 Aug 2025**, and the sandbox will run from **30 Sep 2025** to **9 Jan 2026**[[6]](https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2025/07/fsr-fintech-matters---july-2025#:~:text=The%20Supercharged%20Sandbox%20is%20open,datasets%20and%20more%20advanced%20tooling). Separately, U.S. lawmakers introduced the **Unleashing AI Innovation in Financial Services Act** on **31 Jul 2025**, directing regulators to create “AI Innovation Labs” that let banks and lenders experiment with AI projects without undue regulatory burden[[7]](https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2025/07/bill-would-create-regulatory-labs-for-financial-institutions-to-test-ai/#:~:text=A%20bipartisan%20group%20of%20senators,projects%20at%20financial%20regulatory%20agencies). These initiatives reflect regulators’ desire to encourage innovation while maintaining oversight.
- **Trust and compliance remain barriers.** Research highlighted by Deloitte and summarised in Solutions Review reports that finance and accounting leaders see **trust** – not technology – as the main barrier to adopting agentic AI[[8]](https://solutionsreview.com/artificial-intelligence-news-for-the-week-of-august-1-updates-from-cognizant-deloitte-fractal-more/#:~:text=Deloitte%20Says%3A%20Trust%20a%20Top,Adoption%20in%20Finance%20%26%20Accounting). Concerns focus on transparency, output accuracy and risk mitigation. In the UK, the FCA’s **AI Innovation Lab** and **Consumer Duty** guidance have pushed firms to adopt AI for compliance monitoring: conversation‑intelligence tools can analyse 100 % of customer calls, detect missed affordability checks or vulnerability flags and provide evidence of fair treatment[[9]](https://voyc.ai/ai-strategies-to-improve-customer-outcomes-and-stay-fca-aligned/#:~:text=With%20the%20FCA%20now%20backing,obligations%20in%20a%20meaningful%20way).

## AI model updates & best practices

### Upcoming models and capabilities

- **OpenAI GPT‑5 and open‑weight models.** According to Notepad reporting by *The Verge*, internal testing suggests that GPT‑5 will integrate reasoning capabilities from OpenAI’s o‑series into one model; mini and nano versions will be available through ChatGPT and API, while the nano version may be API‑only[[10]](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%2C%20I%20heard,as%20early%20as%20next%20month). OpenAI is also preparing an open‑weight model (similar to “o3 mini”) and aims to release it before GPT‑5[[2]](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad#:~:text=While%20GPT,risk%20areas.%E2%80%9D). Finance teams should plan for: (1) more accurate analytical reasoning, (2) improved data‑retrieval via retrieval‑augmented generation and (3) licensing considerations for private deployments.
- **Other model highlights.** Recent AI newsletters (The Rundown and Ben’s Bites) reported that AI systems designed cancer‑killing proteins in weeks[[11]](https://www.therundown.ai/p/openai-readies-gpt-5-for-august-debut#:~:text=), and that voice‑based interfaces remain unreliable; AssemblyAI’s new streaming speech‑to‑text API balances speed, cost and accuracy[[12]](https://www.bensbites.com/p/changing-how-theyll-learn#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20talk%20about%20voice). Google’s **NotebookLM** can now convert documents into video overviews[[13]](https://www.bensbites.com/p/changing-how-theyll-learn#:~:text=NotebookLM%20can%20now%20make%20Video,tools%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks), and ChatGPT’s **study mode** encourages prompting that guides users toward answers rather than simply providing them[[14]](https://www.bensbites.com/p/changing-how-theyll-learn#:~:text=ChatGPT%20now%20has%20a%20study,into%20its%20models%20over%20time) – a technique finance analysts can mirror when using chatbots for training or analysis.

### Prompting guidance for finance tasks

- **Context is key.** When asking GPT‑style models to analyse financial statements, include relevant context (e.g., the reporting period, key metrics and desired output format). ChatGPT’s success as a “co‑pilot” for drafting policies, job descriptions and Excel explanations stems from structured prompts that specify audience and tone[[15]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A%20ChatGPT%20is%20a,helpful%20companion%20for%20team%20enablement).
- **Guide rather than answer.** Borrowing from ChatGPT’s study‑mode principles[[14]](https://www.bensbites.com/p/changing-how-theyll-learn#:~:text=ChatGPT%20now%20has%20a%20study,into%20its%20models%20over%20time), prompt the model to ask clarifying questions or outline the reasoning steps for an analysis (e.g., “Explain the assumptions you made when forecasting revenue”); this builds a clear audit trail.
- **Monitor hallucinations.** Use guardrail frameworks benchmarked by Fiddler (as highlighted in The Rundown) to evaluate models on latency, cost and accuracy[[16]](https://www.therundown.ai/p/openai-readies-gpt-5-for-august-debut#:~:text=The%20Rundown%3A%20Fiddler%E2%80%99s%202025%20Enterprise,for%20any%20LLM%20use%20case). In regulated finance contexts, complement LLM outputs with rule‑based validation and human review.

## Finance-specific AI applications

### FP&A, reporting and planning

- **AI‑native platforms.** Concourse and similar FP&A platforms embed AI agents that connect to ERP, HRIS, CRM and data‑warehouse systems, automatically generate variance analyses and board‑ready reports and allow strategic finance teams to query data via natural language[[4]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Finance%20teams%20today%20are%20expected,and%20surface%20insights%20on%20demand). These tools eliminate manual data consolidation, accelerate closing and enable mid‑to‑large finance teams to scale insights without hiring proportional headcount[[17]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Ideal%20Customers%3A%20Concourse%20is%20designed,inform%20executive%20decisions%20with%20precision).
- **Generic LLM assistants.** Finance teams increasingly use ChatGPT to draft policies, summarise documents and translate technical language into plain English[[18]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A%20ChatGPT%20is%20a,a%20helpful%20companion%20for%20team); Claude to summarise long reports and produce digestible talking points[[19]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A%20Claude%20stands%20out,for%20board%20and%20stakeholder%20documents); and Perplexity AI for quick market research and benchmarking[[20]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A%20Perplexity%20acts%20like,market%20benchmarking%20or%20investor%20preparation). These tools are not built for mission‑critical FP&A workflows but provide quick wins for communications and research.

### Credit risk assessment and underwriting

- **AI‑driven underwriting.** The Nelito blog explains how AI transforms credit underwriting: algorithms analyse diverse data (traditional credit scores plus behavioural and digital signals) to produce fast, precise risk assessments[[21]](https://www.nelito.com/blog/the-rise-of-ai-in-credit-risk-and-lending-software.html#:~:text=The%20AI%20Revolution%20in%20Credit,Underwriting). Machine‑learning models continuously learn from historical data to improve default predictions[[22]](https://www.nelito.com/blog/the-rise-of-ai-in-credit-risk-and-lending-software.html#:~:text=Machine%20Learning%20and%20Predictive%20Analytics). Benefits include shorter approval times, fewer manual errors, improved fraud detection and better customer experiences[[23]](https://www.nelito.com/blog/the-rise-of-ai-in-credit-risk-and-lending-software.html#:~:text=Key%20Benefits%20of%20AI,Underwriting). Finance teams should explore off‑the‑shelf AI underwriting platforms and ensure they align with model‑risk management requirements.

### Compliance monitoring and customer outcomes

- **Conversation‑intelligence tools.** With the FCA’s AI Innovation Lab now active[[24]](https://voyc.ai/ai-strategies-to-improve-customer-outcomes-and-stay-fca-aligned/#:~:text=With%20the%20FCA%20now%20backing,obligations%20in%20a%20meaningful%20way), UK financial firms are adopting AI to monitor calls and meet Consumer Duty obligations. AI can analyse 100 % of customer conversations, spot missed affordability checks, detect confusion around settlement figures and identify complaints linked to vulnerability flags[[25]](https://voyc.ai/ai-strategies-to-improve-customer-outcomes-and-stay-fca-aligned/#:~:text=,are%20using%20AI%20today). By linking call data with QA scores and complaints, firms can identify root causes of poor outcomes[[26]](https://voyc.ai/ai-strategies-to-improve-customer-outcomes-and-stay-fca-aligned/#:~:text=2,causes%20of%20poor%20outcomes) and provide targeted coaching to agents[[27]](https://voyc.ai/ai-strategies-to-improve-customer-outcomes-and-stay-fca-aligned/#:~:text=3,world%20examples).

## Industry intelligence & regulatory updates

- **U.S. AI Action Plan and policy divide.** The White House announced a sweeping AI policy agenda in July, aiming to accelerate domestic AI infrastructure, ban ideologically biased models in federal use and promote U.S. models as global standards[[34]](https://www.launchconsulting.com/posts/ai-in-july-2025-what-c-suite-leaders-need-to-know-across-key-industries#:~:text=,to%20federal%20collaboration%20or%20funding). Launch Consulting notes that, for financial services, government backing could make U.S. AI models more trusted for compliance and trading algorithms[[35]](https://www.launchconsulting.com/posts/ai-in-july-2025-what-c-suite-leaders-need-to-know-across-key-industries#:~:text=,banking%20compliance%20or%20trading%20algorithms). At the same time, the EU introduced a voluntary **AI Code of Practice**, signalling diverging regulatory regimes[[36]](https://www.launchconsulting.com/posts/ai-in-july-2025-what-c-suite-leaders-need-to-know-across-key-industries#:~:text=2,Practice%20Sparks%20Global%20Tech%20Divide); global firms may need “dual‑stack” governance.
- **ESMA report on LLMs in finance.** A recent ESMA working paper found that **85 %** of surveyed organisations already use LLMs, with four key application areas: public communication and customer engagement, financial‑service safety (fraud detection, trade surveillance), financial insight generation (market and ESG analysis) and financing/investment activities[[37]](https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2025/07/fsr-fintech-matters---july-2025#:~:text=On%204%20June%202025%2C%20ESMA,current%20and%20future%20regulatory%20framework). The report emphasises challenges such as robustness, data dependency, privacy and bias, and calls for clear accountability[[38]](https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2025/07/fsr-fintech-matters---july-2025#:~:text=at%20various%20levels%2C%20including%20data%2C,challenges%20and%20mitigation%20approaches%2C%20including).
- **FCA research note on LLM pilots.** The FCA’s May 2025 research note concluded that LLMs can simplify complex financial information but require robust evaluation frameworks and context‑dependent deployment[[39]](https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2025/07/fsr-fintech-matters---july-2025#:~:text=On%2030%20May%202025%2C%20the,to%20the%20note%20published%20separately). This underscores the need for human review and tailored evaluation when deploying LLMs for consumer guidance.
- **U.S. legislation on AI innovation labs.** The Unleashing AI Innovation in Financial Services Act would direct the Fed, OCC, SEC, CFPB and other agencies to create AI sandboxes where regulated entities can experiment with AI without undue regulation[[7]](https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2025/07/bill-would-create-regulatory-labs-for-financial-institutions-to-test-ai/#:~:text=A%20bipartisan%20group%20of%20senators,projects%20at%20financial%20regulatory%20agencies). This parallels the FCA’s sandbox and signals increased policy support for experimentation.
- **Trust as a barrier.** Deloitte‑sponsored research indicates that finance and accounting leaders view **trust**—specifically transparency and output accuracy—as the top barrier to adopting agentic AI[[8]](https://solutionsreview.com/artificial-intelligence-news-for-the-week-of-august-1-updates-from-cognizant-deloitte-fractal-more/#:~:text=Deloitte%20Says%3A%20Trust%20a%20Top,Adoption%20in%20Finance%20%26%20Accounting). Organisations recognise the transformative potential of AI but remain cautious without clear governance.

## Practical implementation guide

### Quick wins

1. **Use chat‑based assistants for low‑risk tasks.** Deploy ChatGPT or Claude to draft internal policies, summarise board papers or translate technical documentation; these tasks carry lower risk and deliver immediate productivity gains[[5]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=How%20Finance%20Teams%20Use%20ChatGPT%2C,Claude%2C%20and%20Perplexity). Train staff on prompting techniques (e.g., specifying context, output structure and tone) and require human review.
2. **Adopt conversation‑intelligence tools for compliance.** Implement tools like Voyc’s conversation intelligence to monitor 100 % of customer calls, identify missed disclosures or vulnerability flags and generate evidence of fair outcomes[[25]](https://voyc.ai/ai-strategies-to-improve-customer-outcomes-and-stay-fca-aligned/#:~:text=,are%20using%20AI%20today). Start with a single use case (e.g., affordability checks) and scale once governance processes are in place[[40]](https://voyc.ai/ai-strategies-to-improve-customer-outcomes-and-stay-fca-aligned/#:~:text=If%20you%20can%20show%2C%20not,already%20ahead%20of%20the%20curve).
3. **Leverage FP&A AI‑native platforms.** Pilot an AI‑native FP&A tool (e.g., Concourse) to automate variance analysis and reporting; connect to your ERP/CRM data sources and test real‑time forecasting[[4]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Finance%20teams%20today%20are%20expected,and%20surface%20insights%20on%20demand). Evaluate ROI by comparing cycle times and manual hours saved.

### Strategic initiatives

1. **Prepare for GPT‑5 integration.** Evaluate how integrated reasoning and the availability of mini/nano versions could improve internal analytics and conversational agents. Assess hardware requirements and data‑privacy considerations for potential deployment on private infrastructure.
2. **Participate in regulatory sandboxes.** Apply to the FCA’s Supercharged Sandbox by **11 Aug 2025** to test AI prototypes in a supported environment[[6]](https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2025/07/fsr-fintech-matters---july-2025#:~:text=The%20Supercharged%20Sandbox%20is%20open,datasets%20and%20more%20advanced%20tooling). Monitor the progress of the U.S. AI Innovation Labs bill and consider participation once it passes.
3. **Build trust through governance.** Develop an AI governance framework that addresses data quality, model monitoring, bias mitigation and human‑in‑the‑loop review. Use third‑party responsible‑AI tools (e.g., Arctera) to enhance transparency[[29]](https://solutionsreview.com/artificial-intelligence-news-for-the-week-of-august-1-updates-from-cognizant-deloitte-fractal-more/#:~:text=Arctera%20is%20taking%20aim%20at,between%20innovation%20and%20responsible%20governance). Ensure clear audit trails and documentation for all AI outputs, especially in risk assessment and reporting.
4. **Explore agentic AI platforms.** Investigate emerging agent platforms from AWS and DataRobot that allow autonomous multi‑step tasks[[30]](https://solutionsreview.com/artificial-intelligence-news-for-the-week-of-august-1-updates-from-cognizant-deloitte-fractal-more/#:~:text=AWS%20Bets%20Big%20on%20Agents,the%20Next%20Frontier%20in%20Cloud)[[32]](https://solutionsreview.com/artificial-intelligence-news-for-the-week-of-august-1-updates-from-cognizant-deloitte-fractal-more/#:~:text=DataRobot%20Announces%20Agent%20Workforce%20Platform,Built%20with%20NVIDIA). Potential applications include automating reconciliation workflows, performing complex journal entries or orchestrating month‑end close activities.

## Role‑specific considerations

### Finance Automation Lead / AI SME

- Stay abreast of upcoming model releases (GPT‑5, open‑weight models) and evaluate how to integrate them with your data stack. Consider early testing within the FCA sandbox. Compare guardrail solutions using Fiddler’s benchmark[[16]](https://www.therundown.ai/p/openai-readies-gpt-5-for-august-debut#:~:text=The%20Rundown%3A%20Fiddler%E2%80%99s%202025%20Enterprise,for%20any%20LLM%20use%20case).
- Prioritise building an AI governance toolkit: adopt responsible‑AI tools to monitor model output; work with compliance to ensure alignment with Consumer Duty; use conversation‑intelligence analytics for QA.

### CFO / Head of Finance

- Monitor regulatory developments (FCA sandbox, U.S. AI labs) and update risk and compliance strategies accordingly[[6]](https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2025/07/fsr-fintech-matters---july-2025#:~:text=The%20Supercharged%20Sandbox%20is%20open,datasets%20and%20more%20advanced%20tooling)[[7]](https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2025/07/bill-would-create-regulatory-labs-for-financial-institutions-to-test-ai/#:~:text=A%20bipartisan%20group%20of%20senators,projects%20at%20financial%20regulatory%20agencies). Evaluate the cost‑benefit of investing in AI infrastructure versus partnering with cloud providers. Leverage Anaconda and Cognizant’s data services to support internal model development[[28]](https://solutionsreview.com/artificial-intelligence-news-for-the-week-of-august-1-updates-from-cognizant-deloitte-fractal-more/#:~:text=Anaconda%20Raises%20%24150M%2B%20to%20Power,Source%20Python)[[31]](https://solutionsreview.com/artificial-intelligence-news-for-the-week-of-august-1-updates-from-cognizant-deloitte-fractal-more/#:~:text=Cognizant%20Unveils%20AI%20Training%20Data,Scale%20Model%20Development).
- Address trust barriers by demanding transparent model explanations and establishing cross‑functional oversight. Encourage pilots that generate tangible ROI while emphasising risk mitigation.

### Finance Manager / FP&A Analyst

- Adopt AI‑native FP&A platforms to automate reporting and forecasting; incorporate LLM assistants for summarisation and research tasks[[4]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Finance%20teams%20today%20are%20expected,and%20surface%20insights%20on%20demand)[[5]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=How%20Finance%20Teams%20Use%20ChatGPT%2C,Claude%2C%20and%20Perplexity). Experiment with prompting techniques (ask the model to outline its reasoning) to enhance interpretability.
- Use streaming speech‑to‑text tools (e.g., AssemblyAI API) to capture meeting notes and integrate with calendar/email for quick summaries[[12]](https://www.bensbites.com/p/changing-how-theyll-learn#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20talk%20about%20voice). Explore Perplexity and Claude for competitive intelligence and document summarisation[[20]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A%20Perplexity%20acts%20like,market%20benchmarking%20or%20investor%20preparation)[[19]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A%20Claude%20stands%20out,for%20board%20and%20stakeholder%20documents).

### Finance Associate / Accountant

- Leverage ChatGPT or Claude to draft emails, summarise policy documents and convert technical language into plain English[[18]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A%20ChatGPT%20is%20a,a%20helpful%20companion%20for%20team). Use study‑mode prompting to guide your own learning by asking the model to provide hints rather than direct answers[[14]](https://www.bensbites.com/p/changing-how-theyll-learn#:~:text=ChatGPT%20now%20has%20a%20study,into%20its%20models%20over%20time).
- Familiarise yourself with conversation‑intelligence outputs to understand common call issues (missed disclosures, tone of voice). Provide feedback to QA and suggest improvements.

## Tool of the Week: **Concourse** (AI‑Native FP&A Platform)

**What it does.** Concourse embeds AI agents directly into FP&A workflows, connecting to enterprise data sources and producing real‑time variance analyses, automated forecasts and executive‑ready reports[[4]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Finance%20teams%20today%20are%20expected,and%20surface%20insights%20on%20demand).

**Why it matters for Oakbrook.** Oakbrook’s finance team juggles complex reporting and month‑end close processes. Concourse can automate data consolidation, highlight drivers of variance and generate board decks, reducing manual work and enabling deeper analysis. It is designed for finance leaders (CFOs, FP&A heads, Controllers) and supports natural‑language querying of live data[[4]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Finance%20teams%20today%20are%20expected,and%20surface%20insights%20on%20demand)[[17]](https://www.concourse.co/insights/best-ai-tools-fpa-2025#:~:text=Ideal%20Customers%3A%20Concourse%20is%20designed,inform%20executive%20decisions%20with%20precision).

**Implementation tips.** Start with a pilot that replicates an existing monthly report. Connect Concourse to your ERP and CRM; then use the tool’s natural‑language interface to generate analyses. Compare the output against manual reports for accuracy. Evaluate the cost (subscription) against time saved and improved insight quality.

## Prompt of the Week

**Task:** Generate an executive summary of last month’s financial performance compared with budget, highlighting key drivers, risks and opportunities.

**Prompt:**

You are a financial analyst creating a concise executive summary for the CFO.  You have access to the income statement and variance analysis for July 2025 (actual vs. budget).  Summarise the overall performance in no more than six bullet points.  For each key variance (revenue, cost of funds, operating expenses), identify the primary drivers and explain whether they are temporary or structural.  Conclude with two risks that could impact next month’s performance and two opportunities we should pursue.  Present your answers in plain English without jargon.

**Why it works:** The prompt specifies the audience, the desired length and structure (bullets), the data context (income statement and variance analysis), and asks the model to classify variances as temporary or structural. This guides the model to produce actionable insights and encourages reasoning.

## Next steps

1. **Subscribe to curated AI newsletters.** Continue monitoring *The Rundown* and *Ben’s Bites* for daily AI news and tools. These newsletters provide concise summaries of model releases, research, tools and industry rumours[[41]](https://www.therundown.ai/p/openai-readies-gpt-5-for-august-debut#:~:text=QUICK%20HITS)[[42]](https://www.bensbites.com/p/changing-how-theyll-learn#:~:text=%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F%20Tools%20I%E2%80%99m%20looking%20into).
2. **Create an internal AI knowledge base.** Use a Notion or similar database to archive relevant articles, research notes and tool evaluations. Categorise by use case (FP&A, compliance, risk) and include evaluations of ROI and integration complexity.
3. **Develop a cross‑functional AI task force.** Bring together finance, IT, risk and compliance stakeholders to evaluate new AI initiatives, ensure alignment with regulatory requirements and address trust barriers.
4. **Pilot one strategic initiative.** Choose a high‑impact area (e.g., automated variance analysis or conversation‑intelligence for compliance) and run a pilot in Q3 2025. Document lessons learned and prepare a business case for broader adoption.

This brief synthesises AI developments from leading newsletters, industry reports and regulatory updates over the past few weeks. It aims to help Oakbrook Finance’s leadership stay informed and identify actionable opportunities to enhance efficiency, reduce risk and drive innovation.
