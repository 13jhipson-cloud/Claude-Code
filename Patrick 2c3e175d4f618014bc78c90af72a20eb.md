| Ensuring move allings with development, CIMA, progression, etc | Intentpro (call AI & quickactions) and (contentive/delphi) are getting 1.5m each for the next 6 months - they have this time to prove themselves, then its likely that they get wrapped up into Fospsha.  |  |
| Ensuring development/mentorship continues considering changing roles & line managers - who will feedback to annual review, etc | Both of these will need finance managers (not big enough for FD's). I will be working under these finance manager/managers as finnacial controller of sorts |  |
|  | process automation THEN modelling (helping sam with the models for smaller ventures [understanding them from the ground up]) THEN higher level stuff (weekly reporting, monthly meetings with different CEO's/teams - MAKING A TANGIBLE IMPACT AND PROVIDING SUGGESTIONS)

 |  |
|  | how can I make myself relevant for other people (meetings with other areas of the business - cot discussions - IMPACTING THE BUSINESS) - have monthly with CEO's and budget holders for thes smaller ventures!!!  |  |
|  | OAKRBROOK ;Understanding and automating the finance processes from the ground up, then building upon these newly automated processes (modelling FS's, etc) then higher level stuff (reporting, analysing and interpreting the results, communcing results these to the relevant teams/departments/people [adding value and providing tangible impact by providing suggestions, spotting things, etc]). What position / role would this be leading into? (i.e., no longer finance automation lead) and how can i ensure I get there |  |

| Oakbrook  Roadmap - like the idea of sticking to this plan, gives me stability & progression. Aligns with what we have previously discussed regarding moving onto higher-level work (FP&A, etc) | cost is a good place to start (where can we reduce cost). 
most of the money is made in performance of loans themselves.
- ask emily lots of questions (knowledge transfer from her) - be helpful with people across the business and see where i can help  | Preferred automation tool is UiPath |
| Annual review | I will get the output of annual review (remuneration), etc, end of May/June time, with payslip impact by July possibly. Patrick will talk to Ed, re correct compensation/bonus and their recommendation is what will go across Charles’s desk.

He mentioned salary being competitive with CIMA, etc and wanting to keep hold of us. 

Feedback is good, everyone happy with my performance, work ethic, attitude. Patrick said: “thankyou for your hard work, etc”.
