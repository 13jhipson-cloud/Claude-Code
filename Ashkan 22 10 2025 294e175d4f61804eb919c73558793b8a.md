- what ive been working on: FP&A, forecasting model, etc
- whats important to focus on post forecasting model? more hands on accounting? more fp&A? more AI?
- ensure ive covered all accounting and finance areas? could get stuck in middle management if i wait too long to get the junior finance experience?
- fospha generally - new hires, growing, oppourtunities
- making the most of the BC ‘venture builder’ route whilst getting the correct experience - keep moving and ensure I cover all finance fundmentals OR stay as is and get more specialised into FP&A/Oakbrook/Lending
- finance at fospha, shrey, allinging finance development with CIMA - would there be oppourtunity?

dont sit still - dont get comfortable (always be pushing myself) - humility to succeed - 

be aware of knowledge gaps and be concious that i can leanrn these at any point

then the skill is in presenting and tranlsating the data - dont fall at the final hurdle of presenting teh data and telling the story - make sure i tell the story of this after and be value adding. truly commercial finance is going all the way to the ‘so what’

CIMA is a good yardstick for when to stick/shift. its a race to get through CIMA then think about the best options
