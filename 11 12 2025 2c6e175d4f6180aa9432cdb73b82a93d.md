- Crazy busy few months: India, modelling, budget
- OBF Budget and forecast model: want to do the final bit of setting up variance analysis, etc before doing final runthrough of the model
- recommendations for what to prioritise experience / careerwise now?
    - how BC has changed and expected oppourtunities / trajectory within the company/portfolio (is it just a OBF role now? wider BC opportunities/roles to develop into? recommendations?)
- key deilverables to focus on now to put me in the best position for progression
- any other general updates / portco updates?
