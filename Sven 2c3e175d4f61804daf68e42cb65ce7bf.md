| Topics | Manager/Mentor Comments | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | focus on getting the very basics right - don’t get distracted by FP&A in the short-run |  |
|  | focus on the foundational stuff - make sure the things I do I do PEROPERLY and document them (DON’T IMPROVISE) |  |
|  | think: if someone gave me a small EVO, would I be able to do it all myself? |  |
|  | don’t lose sight of the foundations: learn everything properly from scratch! |  |
|  | stay exposed to the porfolio - don’t tuck away in a corner somewhere. Massive benefit in engaging in RedTeam (increases network, and visiblity) |  |
|  | annual review: set targets above grad level, achieve these, then show that its above grad. if this doesn’t work - then just chat with patrick and make sure my day-to-day work is reflected |  |
|  | New role: first principles, strip back to basics, and automate tasks from the get go - focus on payments side of things (to get the whole picture), then start to build ontop of this (FP&A, etc) |  |
|  | Keep focussing on CIMA |  |
