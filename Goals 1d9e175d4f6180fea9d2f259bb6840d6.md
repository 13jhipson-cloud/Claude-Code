# Goals

**Short-term:**

- find and enjoy a healthy balance of being engaged & excited at work, but being able to turn off from work and having time to priotise my health, social, free-time, etc

**Long-term:**

- More control/flexibility over my time: flexibility to travel / move around (enabled by fully remote job, freelancing, or self employed))
- **Entrepreneur option**: work for myself to some extent (own business, freelance, contract, etc)
- **Employee** **option**: Company with a good work/life balance, flexibility, and encourage health/wellness (cool companies such as BPN, THRST, 24/7, Mike Hurston, etc)
