# Work/Life Mindset

- Never Compromise on my [priorities / values](https://www.notion.so/Priorities-Values-2dce175d4f61806eb4c0f4f4b5598445?pvs=21), [the person I want to be](https://www.notion.so/2b8e175d4f618092821ed3d4f64c9d04?pvs=21), and the life I want to live for work.
- There will always be ‘more important, urgent, work to do’ to keep be constantly busy’.
- I’m only young once.  Find the balance in building the future I want (adequate progression and pushing myself), being engaged with work, and knowing that work is a means to and end not an ends to a mean (it alone doesnt fulfill me).
- I don’t have [dreams](https://www.notion.so/The-Dream-1d9e175d4f618071896be00491e39d7e?pvs=21) of flashy things and lots of money, I have dreams of simple pleasures and peace (so why push myself so hard that it means I don’t even have the time/mental capcity to enjoy the fruits of my labour [look & feel my best, go out and have fun, enjoy my 20s, impress people, etc]).
- The idea is not to lighten the load of what I have to do (aka, tick off the to do list), but to realise its weight so that I put it down (aka, be above it all and still live and happy fulfilled and meaningful life, keeping what’s important to me constant, regardless of workload).
- Make sure I never let my [AM, PM,](https://www.notion.so/Daily-Routine-21ae175d4f61800d933de1d8e9d8dc20?pvs=21) and [Daily Kickoff Routine](../Daily%202bce175d4f6180bfae2bd4b60e3528e9.md) slip, and always make time for a proper lunch break (social or walk)
