**Done**

- **FB-BB Model:**
    - Shared final data requirements with Emily
    - Made significant progress using the ‘Data Model’ to build the BB actuals & forecast triangles on dummy data.
- **Hackathon/FinOps Processes**: Tech Team Hackathon was successful with 7/10 Icenet posting categories automated through API’s / bulk uploads. This will allow us to automate 200-300 manual postings per month once we have reworked the approach to how we source and process the data.
