Doing

FB BB Forecast Model:

**Backbook**

- Data:
    - Cluster older months around known credit events - clusters TBD based off BB curve analysis (using GenAI) of proposed cohorts.
    - Final dataset to include cohorts for the last 18-4 months alongside 2-3 clusters.
- Data Model Changes (Power Query + Power Pivot):
    - Create ‘Segment Map’: maps the data to segments using tags and update the existing queries (Actuals, Dimension tables, etc) to incorporate it and rewire PowerPivot relationships to incorporate this
- Curves:
    - Computing Curves: Create curve queries that compute curves/rates based on the defined segments
    - Overlaying Curves: create an overlays table that can be updated manually. Create a final curves query that incorporates the curves computed from actuals and any overlays, to be used to be used in the forecasting engine

- Forecast Engine:
    - Update forecasting engine to ingest the final curves library (3 queries to update)
- Provisioning Module
    - build provisioning module engine that computes provisions based on forecasted GBV
- Outputs:
    - Update DAX measures.
    - Build outputs (Triangles, Pivots, Graphs, KPI’s, P&L, etc)

**FrontBook**

- Data:
    - model 1 cohort initially; optionally introduce a 2nd FB cohort ~6 months out if unit economics change.
- Forecast Engine:
    - same pattern as BB engine but ‘actuals’ (originations) and curves are inputs from Anil.
