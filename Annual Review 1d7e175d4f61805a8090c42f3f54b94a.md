# Annual Review

Pre-Read

- **DONT COMPARE TO OTHERS!**

What I’ve been working on

- **Koodoo role:** transformed their finances and worked at a finance manager level.
- **Oakbrook role**: finance automation lead (improving & automating finance department). Strategic involvement with AI/Automation solutions (MCP, agenstpace, etc). Now transitioning into FP&A
- **BC:** Well exceeded all BC requirements (training/delivering, OKR’s, values, etc)

Believe I’m operating at higher than standard grad level now.

Why I’m more valuable than 12 months ago

- Progressed from a basic understanding of accounting & finance TO the point that I was able to improve & automate processes AND do the role of a management accountant/finance manager - REAL TANGIBLE OUTCOMES AS A RESULT: [cost savings, improved client relationships, fixing and avoiding errors, time savings, etc)
- Progressed from a PMO analyst assisting Yuan with ERP implementation TO a project manager running my own automation projects both at Koodoo and Oakbrook
- I have pushed up on almost all levels of the CDF - have a lot more responsibility, working at a much higher-level on a lot higher-level stuff, and hit the key milestones / goals that were set out for me.
- Passed CIMA operational level

Role progression

- Oakbrook roadmap is leading into an FP&A manager esq role. What can I do to ensure I get to this?
- Where does this leave me with BC grad program/role (no longer a BC grad… does my BC role change also?)
- Any other things I need to do / achieve ontop of my current roadmap to get progress (communicate these desires) - What does good looks like?

Salary Convo

- **Expectations**: 35 to 40 is realistic - say I’d be super happy with 40.
- **Market Research:** grads with 1-2 years experience in similar roles finance analyst / accounting / automation roles seem to be getting up to 45k. Range is 35 to 45k with larger fintech firms at the higher end.

- **Response to salary number**: Can I just ask how you come to that number? I was thinking more high 30’s / towards 40 based on progression of my work & responsibility.  What I can do to get to that level in the future? What things should I focus on & you value the most?

2800, 38,000 paycheck.

Don’t dissapear into a portco and not be seen again if happy with BC progress

Don’t bother speak to patrick (defo don’t whine, but potentially be on the upside of: exiciting to be working on x,y,z at oakbrook and where that could lead me salary/progression wise)!
