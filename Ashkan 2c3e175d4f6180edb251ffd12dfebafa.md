- April 2025:

| Topics | Manager/Mentor Comments | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | make it as clear as possible - people don’t understand numbers, clear, simple concise - don’t be afriad to simplify - trickle donw, always have everything in your appendix |  |
| FP&A Commentary |  don’t just say the obvious (not 'revenue is behind' instead 'why is revenue behind' (give them the context they don’t know)

think like the rest of the business, what will htye need from this info, don’t just tell them it (e.g., CIMA variance examples) |  |
| General | just get exposure, learning from people (good and bad)

push to stay where I want to |  |
