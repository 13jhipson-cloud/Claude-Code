Is this a conversation that I need to have with Patrick/yourself?

What do you recommend?

- Keen to established a defined/solid role within Oakbrook as I finish the full-time automation project and move into FP&A (discussing with Will best strategy to continue improving & automating but overall plan is for these to become a recurring theme/cadence instead of my full-time focus)
- Think this is aligns well with timing of annual review, completing grad program, etc.
