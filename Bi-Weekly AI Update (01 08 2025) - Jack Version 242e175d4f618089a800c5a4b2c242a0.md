# Bi-Weekly AI Update (01/08/2025) - Jack Version

Big Updates:

- Open AI & Agent Mode: significant improvements on operator combines connectors & ability to interact with browser. GPT 5 is next, which will combine all of these, with reasoning capabilities of the “o‑series” models into a single system.
- Connectors are becoming increasingly avaialable and easy to setup (less need for complex MCP setup etc unless theres specific niche uses-cases). connectors more than good enough for most personal/productivity use-cases. Now really starting to reap the rewards of a good database (notion)
- ManusAI and Context are great for end-to-end workflows (e.g., from nothing to a good powerpoint). Context has added benefit of connectors
- Shortcut AI: this might be the key moment for AI in finance. initial testing is very impressive.

Prompting:

- Borrowing from ChatGPT’s study‑mode principles, prompt models to ask clarifying questions or outline the reasoning steps for an analysis (e.g., “Explain the assumptions you made when forecasting revenue”) to builds a clear audit trail and get way more out of models.
